       <h3> What is Cloud Computing? </h3>
       <p>
           The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud computing as “a model for enabling
           ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,
           networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with
           minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” (Ruparelia 2016, p. 4).
 
           <br>
           That means, rather than having to spend money for purchasing and maintaining costly IT infrastructures ,
           businesses can now rent access to anything from applications, storage, networking, databases, etc. from a
           cloud service provider (CSP) such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, etc (Ranger
           2018).
 
           <br>
           According to Ruparelia (2016, p. 5), cloud computing relies on virtualization technology to work properly.
           The author defined two types of virtualization: server virtualization and application virtualization.
           Whereas application virtualization delivers an application that is hosted on a single machine to a large
           number of users, who would typically access said application via an Internet browser, server virtualization
           uses common physical hardware e.g. networks, storage or computing machines, etc. to host virtual machines.
           <br>
           One of the major cost benefits of server virtualization is that it allows businesses to efficiently
           consolidate a large number of physical machines onto fewer physical machines that host the virtual machines.
           This, in turn, translates to less space, maintenance, cooling, and electricity needed.
           <br>
           Cloud computing generally follows three delivery models, namely:
           <li>
               <b>Public clouds:</b> These are owned and operated by 3rd-party CSPs, of which all hardware, software,
               and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. This model is what most
               people are familiar with, where the consumption of public cloud services (files storage on Google Drive,
               music streaming platforms, Office Online, etc.) happens via the Internet rather than a private or
               restricted network (Ruparelia 2016, p. 30).
           </li>
           <li>
               <b>Private clouds:</b> Here, computing resources are used exclusively by a single business,
               organization, or in some cases, a single person. A private cloud can be physically located on the
               company’s on-site datacenter, allowing the company to control how the data is being used, shared,
               stored, as well as how to build the infrastructure they want. This model is particularly useful for
               organizations that prioritise security and privacy of their data above all else.
           </li>
           <li>
               <b>Hybrid clouds:</b> A combination of public and private clouds, bound together by technology that
               allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move
               between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives businesses greater flexibility in terms of daily
               operations.
 
           </li>
           <br>
       <p>Within these models, there exists three types of cloud services, or “stacks”, as they are built on top of one
           another:
       </p>
       <li>
           <b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):</b> T The most basic category of cloud computing service or the base
           stack, where companies can rent out IT infrastructures such as physical or virtual servicers, storage,
           network on a pay-as-you-go basis.
 
       </li>
       <li>
           <b>Platform as a service (PaaS):</b> The next layer up where CPSs provide an on-demand environment for
           developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. Thus, making it easier for developers to
           quickly create web or mobile apps, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure needed for
           development work.
 
 
       </li>
       <li>
           <b>Software as a service (SaaS):</b> The most common form of cloud computing where applications are
           delivered over the internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis e.g. Google G Suite, Microsoft
           365, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and
           underlying infrastructure. Users connect to the application over the Internet usually via a web browser or
           on their phone or tablet. Ranger (2018, para. 18) noted that SaaS spending in 2019 was dominated by
           application purchases, making up for more than half of all public cloud spending.

       <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
       <p>
           Within the workplace, Ruparelia (2016) predicted two major trends. The first trend is where workstations
           would gradually be replaced by zero or thin clients - machines that do not have applications installed on
           them- where workers would perform most daily tasks via cloud-based application via a web browser e.g.
           document-editing or emailing. This reduces the need for organizations to have to manage all those
           applications installed on a variety of workstation. Another benefit is data security since these thin
           clients would not contain any local disk but instead store data on the cloud (p.63).
 
           <br>
           The second trend is ubiquitous computing or bring your own device (BYOD), where employees can access
           corporate-provided applications and information on their own personal devices anytime and anywhere. The
           COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend by the fact that many employees were forced to work from home,
           often with their own devices. In the future, as more companies adopt the hybrid work model (where employees
           can split their time between working from home and at the office), it is possible to assume that this will
           result in cost reduction for company's IT department in term of It equipment deployment, maintenance, and so
           on.

       <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>

           We predict that our personal lives will come to be more reliant on cloud computing. Specifically, each
           person will have a collection of personal clouds corresponding to their needs & behaviours. For example, an
           entertainment cloud such as Apple TV, Google TV or Roku, where they can get access to their own library of
           on-demand and downloadable content.
 
           <br>
           If we take shopping into account, then our personal shopping cloud: would help us find better deals and
           discounts, (Honey is a good example of a shopping assistant that uses its own cloud to scan the web for
           discounts on major platforms such as Amazon & eBay), analyze our shopping behaviors and buying patterns for
           predictive analysis. E.g if a person regularly buys toilet paper on the 20th then he/she will remind him/her
           to buy the item one or two days prior.
           <br>
           One of the most prominent developments of cloud computing at the moment is the “Cloud of Things” - CoT
           (better known as the Internet of Things or IoT). For example, the current smart homes trend is essentially a
           CoTs that consists of a cloud service (Apple HomeKit, Alexa, Google Home and Samsung SmartThings) that
           collect information from a number of compatible ambient sensors e.g. smoke, light, proximity, etc. as well
           as allow users to control curtains, fire alarms, lighting and heating in his/her homes.
