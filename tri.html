                    <h6>The following is the opinions of three other students within the group regarding this particular
                        team member.</h6>
                    <!-- Vu's feedback -->
                    <h5>Quang Vu</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Whilst I was not able to work directly with Tri in the earlier weeks of the
                        course; he has nevertheless been a delightful lad so far. As we are preparing for our final
                        assignment, Tri has taken on himself to research different game engines and tools e.g. Unity and
                        GameMaker Studio, and watch many tutorials to provide us with useful insights on which tools and
                        platforms are best to turn our Project Idea into a reality. This just goes to show how committed
                        he could be if needed. I am looking to support and advise him during our demo creation process
                        in Assignment 3.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Thu's feedback -->
                    <h5>Anh Thu</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">My first impression about Tri is that he is very friendly and nice. Tri is
                        willing to study and receive other members' feedback. He shows great commitment to the team
                        projects and always completes the task before the deadline. He also watched many tutorial videos
                        about tools for the project ideas and downloaded the game engine to experience using that app.
                        It is my pleasure working with an enthusiastic and inquisitive man like Tri.
                    </p>
                    <!-- My's feedback -->
                    <h5>Thao My</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Despite having a Entertainer' Myer-Briggs test result, I noticed that Tri is a
                        surprisingly calm and tranquil person for most of the team communication. He offered helpful
                        insights and comments when asked for, but he remains a dedicated researcher and patient listener
                        for a lot of our discussions. As I become more adjusted to his working style, I felt thankful
                        that our team has such a strongly independent and initiative member like Tri. This is evidenced
                        in his strong dedication to achieve maximum quality in group work, or being the first to install
                        and have first-hand experience of different testing game engines for the assignment 3. Similar
                        to Thu, Tri upholds a high level of integrity and commitment to his task, often being the one to
                        put in that necessary extra mile. Iâ€™m likewise thankful that Tri has joined our team. </p>

                    <h5>Myself</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In comparison to my teammates, this is my first semester at RMIT. Due to my inexperience with
                        writing assignments, I ran into some difficulties writing and citing, but my teammates were
                        extremely helpful. However, I believe that my overall contribution to the team has been
                        noteworthy. I'm hoping to improve my coding skills in order to complete my job while also honing
                        my design skills in order to assist Vu with the mock up.
