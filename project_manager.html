           Meetings with management, deliberating over project-related issues, and team meetings with developers and
           testers are all part of her typical day. Additionally, weekly meetings are held to discuss finances and
           scheduling and she must solicit feedback directly from stakeholders.

           They gather needs from end-users and stakeholders every day. Then collaborate with developers. Many of these
           are daily standup meetings of 15 minutes to review the previous day's work and the day's agenda.

           Kanika believes that insisting on transparency is critical while dealing with multiple parties. She said
           "I'm
           accountable for ensuring that my engineers understand end-user requirements and for notifying management to
           potentially dangerous situations or schedule changes. Maintaining an eye on the deadline and notifying
           everyone if we fall short." COVID-19 meetings were held online, making efficient use of internet tools even
           more difficult. At times, this entails "working a little bit harder, longer, and responding to emails more
           rapidly."
