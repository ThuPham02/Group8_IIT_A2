                    <p class="card-text">My name is Vu and I am currently a final-year student at RMIT University.
                        Originally come from the School of Communication and Design (SCD), particularly the Professional
                        Communication program, I have dedicated this last general elective of mine to explore the
                        growing field of Information Technology (IT); hence, my enrollment within the Introduction to IT
                        itself. With the current advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML),
                        it is safe to assume that in the near future, AI and automation would come for my bread and
                        butter as a communicator. For instance, Vox (2017) highlighted how automation was used to edit a
                        news video from scratch (video), or how the rapid development of Natural Language Processing
                        (NLP) enabled softwares to “write” virtually coherent bodies of texts (video). Thus, by taking
                        this course, I am hoping to get an overview of the IT field as a whole to better inform my
                        decision to change my career path in the future.

                    <p class="card-text">Hi! My name is Pham Anh Thu and my student number is s3878246. I was born and
                        raised in Ho Chi Minh City despite that both of my parents come from the North of Vietnam. This
                        is my third semester at RMIT but it is my first semester as an IT student. In terms of
                        languages, I can speak English and I am in the process of learning French and obtaining the DELF
                        B2. To be honest, I am a low-tech person. My IT interest only started when I met my boyfriend
                        whose major is IoT. He has taught me some basic codes as well as inspired me to change my major
                        to IT. I do not have much experience in IT but during my semester gap, I have learned basic
                        Python and some Python packages such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib; HTML and CSS. Recently, I
                        have made a personal project related to data to enforce my knowledge. In my spare time, I enjoy
                        watching anime, especially the psychological ones that make me feel excited but also nervous
                        such as Liar Game, Tomodachi Game, and so on. I also love jogging, playing badminton, and
                        hanging out with friends.

                    <p class="card-text">Hi! My name is Lai Minh Tri, but if you have difficulties pronouncing it, you
                        may call me Jay. My student ID is s3927026, and you may reach me by email at
                        laiminhtri@gmail.com. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, and I've been living in my
                        house in District 7 since 2017. Aside from my native language, I am fluent in English and
                        Japanese. In my spare time, I'd like to spend time with my friends, particularly to play games
                        or watch movies and spend quality time together. My pastime has been travelling and playing
                        basketball since I was a youngster, and it would be good to have some pals to do it with. IT has
                        such an impact on our everyday lives that I remember watching a YouTube video when I was younger
                        about a man attempting to automate every fundamental task in his life. At the time, I had
                        decided to pursue a career as an AI developer. I attend this course with a learning attitude, I
                        do not know much about IT but I have great passion and interest about it.

                        student ID is s3922086. I come from the rolling green hills of Pleiku City, Gia Lai province and
                        it’s my second semester at RMIT. I used to study abroad in Texas, United States for four years
                        throughout high school before moving back to Vietnam. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to
                        podcasts, practising the piano, and singing. My interest in IT began in my 10th grade in High
                        School, where I first familiarised myself with Matlab. Though it was for a friend’s suggestion,
                        I began researching deeper in the field of programming and IT and began taking courses on
                        Coursera in my spare time. Although I initially pursued the Digital Marketing program in hope of
                        becoming a market analyst, I decided to switch to Information Technology as I began to realize
                        my passion for the technological aspects of the job. Some of my current IT experience are
                        Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tableau. I’m currently working on gaining JavaScript and SQL
                        experience through Youtube, LinkedIn Learning and Coursera self-guided Projects.
