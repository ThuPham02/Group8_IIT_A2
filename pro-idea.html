        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="overview">
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>We want to create a game that inspires people to pursue careers in art, business, communications,
                information technology, education, and healthcare. A visually appealing cross-platform online game that
                can be played on both mobile and desktop devices. This software enables adolescents to explore their
                future workplace, gain knowledge about their chosen career path, and socialise with their peers.
                Developing the app may require a strong grasp of programming, debugging, character design, and workspace
                design.

        <!-- Motivation -->
        <div class="motivation">
            <h3>Motivation:</h3>
            <p>The reason why we decided to take on this initiative is that, for us, choosing a career is a gamble. This
                is due to a lack of prior experience and real-world resources on the part of the students. In order for
                people to make this critical decision with confidence, we want them to have a realistic experience
                first. We also have witnessed several of our friends struggle with comparable concerns. According to
                Thanh Nien News, nearly half of students get employment in an area that is unrelated to their primary
                profession after completing their studies, wasting both time and money (Ha Anh 2020). We were inspired
                by this predicament to develop an interactive platform that was both amusing and educational.

        <!-- Description -->
        <div class="description">
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This is an app that promotes collaboration in certain career categories such as art, business,
                communications, information technology, education, and healthcare. However, we will initially
                concentrate on information technology jobs. There are currently two game modes available in the game.
                <br>
                <b style="color:chocolate">[Overview Mode]</b> This mode provides an overview of the situation at a high
                level. When a player first
                enters the game, they are presented with an overall performance assessment. As a result, they would
                perform a variety of related tasks in order to determine the industry's most advantageous specialisation
                path. In the technology sector, these tasks could be accomplished in the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Examine reports for grammatical errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Utiliser code blocks (Scratch, MakeCode, and so on) to address a specific issue (beginner-friendly)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select one of four options to ensure that you understand what a syntax error means.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Following that, their performance is evaluated, and they are given a questionnaire to complete regarding
            their level of satisfaction with the tasks assigned to them. After combining these two metrics, the system
            generates a comprehensive report that details the user's compatibility with various interconnected careers
            in the industry. Consider the following hypothetical situation: User A earned an average score of 80% in the
            report writing phase and 60% in the debugging phase. Additionally, his questionnaire response demonstrated a
            high level of interest in those tasks. As a result, when he works as a quality assurance or quality control
            tester, he will receive a high compatibility score.
            <br>
            <b style="color: chocolate;">[Specialisation Mode]</b> Later on, after receiving feedback and
            recommendations from the system, they progress
            to learning more about their chosen career through the game's specialisation mode, which enables them to
            hone their knowledge of specific aspects of their chosen profession. Each job is assigned 4-5 tasks in this
            mode, and the individual will gain a thorough understanding of the job by immersing themselves in all of
            them (a day in the life). For instance, a software engineer's responsibilities would include writing code,
            debugging, and communicating with other departments.
            <br>
            Please keep in mind that neither of these modes has any levels (Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced) so that the
            interaction and tasks are as simple as possible, and rather than covering a broad range of industries, we
            will focus exclusively on the occupation of software engineer in the specialisation mode. However, if this
            is something we find fascinating, we will apply it to other jobs as needed.
            <br>
            Due to the fact that this is merely a proposal for assignment 2, we have painted a rather colourful picture
            of the project in this document. This will almost certainly change as we confront realities and come to
            terms with the constraints of our time. However, the project is currently in the state described in the
            preceding section.

        <div class="tool-tech">
            <h3>Tools and Technology:</h3>
            <p>
                As this is a multiplayer game, we use a dedicated game server such as Amazon GameLift to improve the
                game's performance, manage high traffic, and save money (AWS n.d.). Additionally, Unity Game enables us
                to concentrate on developing games for PC and mobile platforms and provides a plethora of features for
                game developers (Unity n.d.). C# and C++ would be the primary programming languages used in this
                project, as they would be responsible for generating the movement and interaction between players and
                their environment. Adobe will be used to design the graphics, and FMOD will be used to create the sounds
                and music tracks.

        <!-- Skills required -->
        <div class="skill">
            <h3>Skills Required:</h3>
            <p>Due to the complexity of this game, which includes incredible graphics, multiple functions, and a
                thorough understanding of various work fields, we must work collaboratively to achieve the best results.
                As a result, soft skills such as collaboration, communication, presentation, problem solving, and
                strategic planning are necessary. Additionally, this application requires programming skills in C++ and
                C# to operate the characters and the game as a whole. Additionally, because graphics and designs play a
                significant role in attracting customers, team members should be familiar with design tools and possess
                an aesthetic sense and drawing ability.

        <!-- Outcome -->
        <div class="outcome">
            <h3>Outcome:</h3>
            <p>If the initiative is successful, our company will garner increased attention and investment. As a result,
                we can continue to add new features, fix bugs, and improve the aesthetics. Additionally, students who
                are concerned about their future careers may try out a variety of occupations before deciding on the
                best fit. Students can use this game to help them save time and money when selecting a university
                degree. Numerous businesses will benefit from the outcome of this game, as young people who are able to
                apply their university knowledge to their work initiatives will be more effective and efficient.
