       <h3> What is Cybersecurity? </h3>
       <p>
           Cybersecurity is the safeguarding of internet-connected devices, such as hardware, software, and data. The
           method is used to prevent unauthorised access to data centres and other digital systems. A strong
           cybersecurity plan can deter intruders from gaining access to, altering, deleting, destroying, or extorting
           data. Additionally, it aids in the prevention of attacks intended to disable or harm a system or device,
           which it also does. Today's businesses employ an increasing number of people, devices, and programs and
           generate an increasing amount of data, some of which is private or sensitive. Cybersecurity is becoming
           increasingly critical. The number and skill of cyber attackers, as well as their attack strategies, are
           increasing, exacerbating the problem. The cybersecurity field is divided into a number of distinct
           subfields, each of which must be coordinated internally to ensure the effectiveness of a cybersecurity
           program. Several of the components include the following:
 
           <br>
 
           <li>Application security</li>
 
           <li>Disaster recovery/business continuity planning</li>
 
           <li>Operational security</li>
 
           <li>Cloud security</li>
 
           <li>Critical infrastructure security</li>
 
           <li>Physical security</li>
 
           <li>End-user education</li>
           <br>
           Businesses have to keep their cybersecurity up-to-date because threats are always changing. Traditional
           reactive techniques, which focused on protecting systems from the most dangerous threats while leaving
           lesser-known threats unprotected, are no longer enough. A more proactive and flexible approach is needed to
           stay on top of new security threats. Many well-known cybersecurity advisory firms offer help. For example,
           the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), wants to add continuous monitoring and real-time
           assessments to a risk assessment framework in order to fight both known and unknown risks that can happen at
           any time. (Shea Sharon 2021)
           <br>
           Our personal and business lives are increasingly done online, which makes cybersecurity a major issue for
           our generation. Having a good idea of the future of cybersecurity will help you make the most of your
           resources and stay safe not just today but also in the future. In the last few years, artificial
           intelligence (AI) has become more and more common as a tool. Automate everyday tasks, analyze data, and make
           decisions faster than humans can now. However, new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, have
           cybersecurity risks because they haven't been found yet. Future programmers may use artificial intelligence
           to tell people about dangerous websites or bad security decisions that they should avoid. In addition, AI
           can simulate network attacks to show where there are flaws that need to be fixed.
           <br>
           As more businesses use machine learning for important tasks, hackers are sure to try to get into AI systems.
           As a result, cybersecurity software and humans will need to be able to detect and fight AI corruption
           threats in the future. In a study by Michel Cukier, a researcher at the University of Maryland, computer
           hacks have become so common that they happen every 39 seconds. Automated scripts are used to carry out most
           attacks. They search through databases and digital addresses for flaws that can be exploited.
           <br>
           To protect their businesses from cyberattacks, businesses now need to spend more money than ever. However,
           even expensive software can only do so much to protect businesses from threats. Increased security budgets
           don't work unless they are set up and managed by someone who knows about information security (infosec). The
           problem is that there aren't a lot of people like that at the moment. According to a survey by the Global
           Information Security Workforce, by 2022, there will be a shortage of more than two million jobs in the field
           of information security. In this environment, it will be very expensive and difficult to hire cybersecurity
           professionals. As a result, smart businesses will spend a lot of money on current employee information
           security training. Many ethical hacking courses, like those offered by Cybrary, are already available to
           people in the IT field.
           <br>
           In 2017, WannaCry ransomware hit about 200,000 computers in 150 countries that had out-of-date versions of
           Windows. There are many possible reasons for this. As a start, manufacturers don't have to keep delivering
           security patches for older systems, even if new flaws are found. Despite this, businesses keep putting
           themselves at risk of cyberattacks by relying on outdated technology. This is often done to save money or
           because the business doesn't know about the extra security benefits. If this keeps up, there is no reason to
           think it won't. In the future, it could get worse. Many businesses and people are happy with the servers,
           workstations, and phones of the current generation. When today's cutting-edge technology is out of date,
           many people won't want to change, and hackers will pay attention. Businesses and cybersecurity experts need
           to be ready. (Maryville University 2016)

       <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
       <p>
           According to a survey conducted by the Australian Cybersecurity Growth Network, the global cybersecurity
           market will reach more than $270 billion in value by 2026. Even as the digital transformation accelerates,
           boardrooms continue to place a premium on cyber risk management.
 
           <br>
           The virtual desktop is set to gain popularity: As more people work from home, virtual desktops may be
           required to establish data management policies. By including input and output devices, software, and
           applications in the list, IT administrators can restrict access to a virtual desktop. This may be
           advantageous for individuals who work remotely and are not connected to the company's network. Many
           businesses will use virtual desktops to comply with extremely stringent regulatory and corporate data
           security requirements, allowing them to use them.
           <br>
           The use of decentralised cybersecurity will increase significantly. Centralising cybersecurity controls
           necessitates the collection and analysis of data from a variety of sources. As more and more things become
           digital, security controls will migrate to the locations where data is stored, such as the Internet of
           Things. Over the next few years, endpoint-based firewalls, data loss prevention, digital rights management,
           and other types of security may gain popularity.
           <br>
           Hackers have shifted their focus away from large corporations and toward individuals who work from home. To
           combat the cyber threat, an increasing number of businesses will employ decentralised cybersecurity, which
           will focus on data sources such as remote employees. Additionally, businesses and their employees would need
           to exercise caution with what they post on social media, as hackers frequently use these platforms to gather
           information prior to launching a cyberattack.
           <br>
           Machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as augmented reality and virtual reality, will gain
           popularity. Video conferencing solutions will gain popularity as non-contact interactions become more
           prevalent. Robots with augmented and virtual reality skills will improve retail, hospitality, and
           manufacturing. While factory owners will benefit from greater productivity as a result of digitising
           labour-intensive activities, it will be compromised if cybersecurity is not included early on.
           <br>
           Cybersecurity is unquestionably a growing job industry. According to official projections, job growth will
           average 37% each year through 2022, which is probably conservative. In January alone, about half a million
           cybersecurity jobs became vacant in the United States. (International, India WentworthDeltaNet, et al 2018)

       <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
       <p>
           Technology is becoming more pervasive and integrated into our daily lives, increasing our reliance on it.
           Making things simple puts us at risk. As a result, cyber security is a critical issue that affects both our
           personal and professional lives. According to Forbes, infected devices can spread the virus to other
           devices, while hacked networks put everyone at risk. Your friends and family's information can easily be
           stolen if you use weak passwords, send unsolicited emails, or behave inappropriately on social media. The
           prospect of being held accountable for cybercrime committed against family members is extremely upsetting.
           Hackers could use an enticing link or direct message on social media to gain access to networks and steal
           vital data. Employees who use social media during their lunch breaks are more likely to engage in risky
           behavior. This is why it is critical to have a clear social media policy and to educate employees on how to
           use social media safely. This is because there are now a plethora of applications and platforms that require
           a password. These include social networking sites and online banking, as well as PINs for mobile phones and
           email. Users must establish a strong password policy to ensure the security of their critical systems and
           applications. (Ritesh Kumar 2020)
 
           <br>
           In a modern business, there are more people, devices, and programs. Additionally, there is more data, the
           majority of which is private or confidential. As a result, cybersecurity has become a more critical job in
           the modern world. Cyber-attackers are becoming more sophisticated and numerous. This further complicates
           matters. As someone who aspires to be a cybersecurity professional, this trend affects me. While there will
           always be a need for cybersecurity professionals, this also means that I will need to work harder to improve
           my IT skills and be on the lookout for new ways to enhance our cybersecurity programs.
