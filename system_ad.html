       <p>
           Henok Tilahun and Maria Lopez are both System Administration (SysAdmin henceforth) for Raytheon Technologies
           and Smart Action respectively. Some of Henok’s responsibilities include configuring and maintaining Linux
           servers, troubleshooting issues related to networking, configurations, or hardware, administering Atlassian
           products (Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket), as well as providing backup solutions via NetBackup (Tilahun
           n.d.). This is briefly reflected in his YouTube video where he was requested to make a backup of department
           data their server was getting decommissioned (Henok 2021).
 
           <br>
           Not surprisingly, his duties also consist of help desk-related work such as monitoring alerts and tickets
           via email/Zabbix to respond or resolve appropriately (Tilahun n.d.).
 
           <br>
           Maria, on the other hand, deals more with the networking and infrastructure side of things, from managing
           equipment in two data centers (network infrastructure, servers, and software) to administering networking
           monitoring systems and log management (Lopez n.d.).
 
           <br>
           She was also responsible for setting up office equipment, specifically workstations, peripherals (monitors,
           keyboard and mouse, etc.), and making sure that they are connected to the company’s network. Another (not so
           glamorous) aspect of her job was cable management, of which she had to run the cable from each of the
           computers through the router, switcher, and patch panel in the office’ network rack (Mimz Techritory 2021).
 
           <br>
           Christoph Puetz from IT Career Guide (2020) gave a more indepth look into the life of a system
           administrator. He particularly pointed out that Sys Admins often work irregular schedules which require
           flexibility e.g. working overtime into the evenings or working on weekends. Puetz also advised aspiring Sys
           Admins to regularly check IT-related news and development to be up-to-date with the trends and new
           technologies.

           Garth Schulte highlighted one of the perks of being a Sys Admin is being able to work with almost all of the
           departments within a company, whether it would be finance, legal, operation, as they all rely on the IT team
           to carry out day-to-day activities normally (CBT Nuggets 2019). Puetz added Sys Admins also get to work with
           external vendors and manufacturers who supply the company with their products and services.

           Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, none of the videos depicted scenes of working in an office
           environment. For Henok, he spent most of his time working from home by remotely accessing his company’s
           system and tools via the Internet. As for Maria, for two days she was in charge of transforming an empty
           office to one that is all set up and ready (workstations installed and network working) for end users to
           move in.

       <p>
           Puetz stated that Sys Admins should learn how to be structured and organised in day-to-day operations,
           whether they were specialised in one or two areas or more jack-of-all-trades, well-rounded in terms of scope
           of work and expertise (IT Career Guide 2020). Byatt (2020) also stressed that Sys Admins, among other IT
           roles, should never give in to the “Because I’ve always done it that way” mentality which deters innovation,
           creative thinking and problem solving skills in the long run.
