                    <h6>The following is the opinions of three other students within the group regarding this particular
                        team member.</h6>
                    <!-- Vu's feedback -->
                    <h5>Quang Vu</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Out of all of us, My was the glue holding the team together. She is the one who
                        hosts weekly meetings, records our meeting minutes and allocates tasks for everyone, in other
                        words, ensuring that our group sail in the right direction. Within our meetings, My also takes
                        everyone’s input into consideration, encourages everyone to contribute equally, and makes sure
                        all of us agree on a chosen topic before moving on, all traits of a future team leader. All in
                        all, working with My has been an enjoyable experience.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Thu's feedback -->
                    <h5>Anh Thu</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">My is the youngest member of our group but I think her working style is really
                        professional and dedicated. Her role is like a secretary in the group where she has taken
                        detailed notes during our meetings. Thanks to My and her notes, I can keep up with my team and
                        finish my work before the deadlines. She is the first to raise her voice and create a
                        comfortable atmosphere when there is only silence during the meeting. Similar to Vu, My shows
                        great writing and analytical skills that can be proved in her works. I really appreciate having
                        this young amazing girl on our team.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Tri's feedback -->
                    <h5>Minh Tri</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">While being the youngest member of our team, I see My as our team leader. She
                        was the one who assembled our team and also served as the one that held us together. My always
                        plan our meeting and her notes have helped us review our work and stay ahead of the deadline.
                        She is the one who broke the ice when the meeting became silent, providing us with an
                        opportunity to present our idea in a relaxed manner. All of this, combined with exceptional
                        writing and analytical abilities, demonstrates that she possesses all of the characteristics
                        necessary to be an effective team leader. It's been a pleasure to have My on our team, and I'm
                        looking forward to the outcome of this course.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Myself</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Regarding my attitude and contribution to group work, something I wished I could have done more
                        of is learning to better control the flow of meetings in the first few discussions our team had,
                        as well as contributing more to the technical aspects of the website development. Despite these
                        weaknesses, I think that I did reasonably well in supporting the team and setting up preparation
                        materials. These include suggesting meeting date and time, task division sheet, writing meeting
                        minutes, etc. I also contributed equally to assignment 2’s report writing and suggesting new
                        ideas and concepts for assignment 3. Overall, I’m satisfied with the level of effort I have
                        contributed to the team’s overall progress.
