                    <h6>The following is the opinions of three other students within the group regarding this particular
                        team member.</h6>
                    <!-- Vu's feedback -->
                    <h5>Quang Vu</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">As a recent business-major-turned-IT-undergrad, Thu already exhibited
                        substantial technical IT experiences i.e. coding and web programming, making her a valuable
                        member of the team. I appreciate her efforts in turning my website design into a functional,
                        working product. Our team also chose to move forward with her Project Idea - a digital career
                        exploration platform - for our future assignment, which is both ambitious and meaningful. Should
                        our third assignment go off without a hitch, then it would mean a shining achievement for her
                        academic journey at RMIT.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Tri's feedback -->
                    <h5>Minh Tri</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Thu has always felt like an older sister to me. When everyone else is talking,
                        she will remain silent and listen to us, always providing excellent advice and opinions. She
                        even reads our work and provides constructive comments. Thu also developed our website for
                        Assignment 2 and guided us through the process of using GitHub; as a result, our website
                        functioned as intended thanks to her. I am grateful to have such a dedicated teammate as her.
                    </p>
                    <!-- My's feedback -->
                    <h5>Thao My</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Thu is a brilliant individual who’s both supportive as a team player and
                        dedicated to her own work. She’s determined to not only finalize her assignments well and
                        on-time, but to do so with the maximum level of attention and quality. Thu is the member who
                        puts the extra mile in her research and responsibilities. Her analytical skills come in handy
                        when proofreading other member’s submissions and giving constructive criticism and feedback.
                        Also, Thu contributed immeasurably in developing the foundation of the web for the assignment 2
                        and 3. I’m thankful we have a wonderful and bright student like Thu in our team.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Myself -->
                    <h5>Myself</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        As for the team website, I still lack experience in programming and my code is not clean and
                        precise enough. I need to learn more about JavaScript and Backend as well. But overall, I think
                        that I have done my best in completing my content, making the website’s structure with the help
                        of Vu Le and giving appropriate comments for other members’ parts. I hope that our final work
                        can meet the lecturer’s expectations.
